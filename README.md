The SAFE-DRIVE system is a novel approach to prevent accidents caused by drowsy and 
intoxicated driving. It utilizes a combination of sensors including a tilt sensor, an eyeblink sensor, 
and an alcohol detection sensor to detect the driver's level of fatigue and intoxication.
By identifying drivers who are sleepy and who have consumed alcohol, the gadget hopes to 
increase road safety. Through a variety of sensors, the anti-sleep driver device keeps track of the 
driver's intoxication and alerts him or her when it notices signs of fatigue. According to the alcohol 
detecting system, the engine cannot start if the alcohol content in the driver's breath is over the 
legal limit. This function aids in the reduction of accidents brought on by intoxicated driving. If 
the alcohol is not detected in the breath it checks for the signs of drowsiness and if the sign of 
drowsiness is detected, then the Engine will not start. The integration of the two technologies 
provides a comprehensive solution to reduce the risks associated with impaired driving, ultimately 
leading to safer roads for everyone.
This system represents a significant technical development in the promotion of traffic safety and 
the prevention of accidents brought on by intoxication and sleepiness.
